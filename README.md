![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/1DDEQvu.png)

This converter takes Excel files and converts them directly to CSV files without changing the columns or rows in any way. There is a limit to the size and quantity of files that can be processed so use cases will vary but simple operations and files will benefit from the elimination of manual conversion.

Users can download the converted files as individual CSV files or as a zip file containing all files when multiple files are uploaded.
